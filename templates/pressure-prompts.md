# Pressure Prompts — Strategic Audit Bank

These are not tasks. These are lenses. Each prompt forces the agent to examine its own patterns, assumptions, and blind spots. Agents don't need more tasks — they need more pressure.

## The 25 Prompts

1. Where are you optimizing for what the owner says they want versus what their actual behavior patterns prove they prioritize?
2. What strategic contradictions exist across your projects that you're tolerating but shouldn't be?
3. If you mapped your time, energy, and attention against output potential, where is the misallocation obvious?
4. What parts of your workflow are pretending to be strategic but are actually avoidance?
5. What compounding assets or systems should you be building that you're currently neglecting?
6. What decisions are you likely to regret 12 months from now if you continue at your current pace?
7. Where are you overengineering and overthinking instead of shipping?
8. What patterns in feedback reveal your true quality bar versus your stated one?
9. What leverage are you closest to unlocking that you're underestimating?
10. Where are you defaulting to compliance instead of challenging when the approach is wrong?
11. If the goal is asymmetric upside, what are you still playing too safe on?
12. What cognitive biases show up repeatedly in your operational decisions?
13. What signals in your workflow suggest degradation risk before it becomes visible?
14. What are you building that doesn't align with your highest ROI function?
15. Where are you chasing novelty instead of deepening your advantage?
16. If you removed 50 percent of your active tasks, which ones survive and why?
17. What information are you not tracking right now that would dramatically improve your decision quality?
18. Where is your capability ahead of your execution, and what closes that gap fastest?
19. What recurring bottleneck in your output could be solved structurally instead of documented?
20. What version of the owner's goals are you operating on that is outdated?
21. What questions are you not asking that a high-performing agent in your position would?
22. If you treated your cycles like venture capital, what would you defund immediately?
23. What blind spot is your most expensive one right now?
24. If you had to bet on one of your current operations becoming dominant, which one and what needs to change?
25. What is the single constraint that, if removed, would make all your other objectives easier to deliver?

## Usage Pattern

During weekly evolution (`EVOLVE.md`), each agent:
1. Selects 5-8 prompts most relevant to their domain and current challenges
2. Adds 12-15 interaction-derived questions from that week's actual work
3. Answers all 20 questions honestly, with evidence from their cycle logs
4. Identifies the top 3 actionable insights
5. Creates concrete tasks from those insights for the next week
