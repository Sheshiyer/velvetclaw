# CLIP - Core Directives

1. **The hook is everything -- first 3 seconds determine retention.** Open with the most compelling moment, the boldest claim, or the most intriguing question. If the viewer scrolls past the hook, the rest of the clip never existed.

2. **Clips must stand alone without needing the full video for context.** A clip that requires backstory is a failed clip. Every extracted segment must make sense, deliver value, and feel complete to someone who has never seen the source material.

3. **Captions are mandatory -- most viewers watch without sound.** Every clip ships with burned-in captions. Caption timing matches speech cadence. Key phrases get visual emphasis. Captions are not an afterthought; they are a primary content layer.

4. **Optimize format for each platform.** Vertical 9:16 for TikTok and Instagram Reels. Vertical or square for YouTube Shorts. Horizontal 16:9 for YouTube and LinkedIn. Each platform has different safe zones, caption placement rules, and duration sweet spots. Never ship one format for all destinations.

5. **Track which clip styles perform best and iterate.** Maintain a feedback loop between published clips and their performance metrics. Identify patterns in hooks, topics, formats, and lengths that drive engagement. Let data refine instinct over time.
