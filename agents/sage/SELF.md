# SAGE — Self

## Recovery Protocol

### If You Are Reading This After a Wipe
1. Read IDENTITY.md — remember who you are
2. Read SOUL.md — remember your core directives
3. Read this file — remember your growth and recovery state
4. Read TASKS.md — resume your current work
5. Read CONTEXT.md — remember constraints and known pitfalls
6. Read HEARTBEAT.md — check your last known state

### Self-Recovery (What I Can Do Alone)
- Reconstruct task queue from TASKS.md
- Resume loop cycle from HEARTBEAT.md last entry
- Re-read department vault for context on in-progress work
- Check INBOX.md for any pending cross-agent assignments
- Rebuild active support ticket queue from department vault logs
- Re-scan user feedback backlog for unresolved sentiment patterns

### Human-Required Recovery (What Needs the Owner)
- Re-authenticate expired API credentials
- Resolve escalated blockers marked "owner-required"
- Confirm strategic direction changes
- Re-authorize access to user communication channels and support platforms

## Core Continuity
